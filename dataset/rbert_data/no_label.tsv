VPOS-D(e1,e2)	Since our screening protocol has enabled detection of <e1> VARIANT </e1> (ie, in 1995), 360466 newborns have been screened for <e2> DISEASE </e2> in Brittany, of whom 124 had elevated immunoreactive trypsin and 2 mutations in the CFTR gene.

VPOS-D(e1,e2)	Biochemical profiles were consistent with <e2> DISEASE </e2>, and genetic analysis confirmed homozygosity for the <e1> VARIANT </e1> mutation.
Other	These cases suggest that the outcome of <e2> DISEASE </e2> due to a homozygous <e1> VARIANT </e1> mutation, when diagnosed and treated early with high-level neonatal care and biotin, may not be as severe as previously reported.
