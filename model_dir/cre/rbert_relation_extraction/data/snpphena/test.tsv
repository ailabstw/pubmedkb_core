Other	The aim of this study was to investigate whether a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2, VARIANT and <e1> VARIANT </e1>) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR, VARIANT and VARIANT) genes was associated with <e2> DISEASE </e2>, response or remission.

Other	For this purpose, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 6930G>A ( <e1> VARIANT </e1>) and 9073G>A ( VARIANT), within the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR), were studied in a cohort of 185 patients with major <e2> DISEASE </e2> (50.3%) or DISEASE I or II disorders (49.7%) and 192 matched healthy controls.

VPOS-D(e1,e2)	A positive association between the GG genotype of <e1> VARIANT </e1> SNPs (6930G>A or 9073G>A) and unipolar <e2> DISEASE </e2> was demonstrated.
VPOS-D(e1,e2)	For <e1> VARIANT </e1>, overtransmission of the G allele to probands with <e2> DISEASE </e2> disorder was found which contrasts with the overtransmission of A previously reported in the Chinese Han sample.
VPOS-D(e1,e2)	RESULTS: The family-based association test (FBAT) revealed a significant genetic association between <e2> DISEASE </e2> and two of the SNPs tested ( <e1> VARIANT </e1> A: Z = 2.287, p = .0222; VARIANT A: Z = 2.573, p = .0101).

VPOS-D(e1,e2)	When haplotypes were constructed with two, three, and four markers, the haplotype-specific FBAT revealed that a number of haplotypes, particularly those involving <e1> VARIANT </e1>, were significantly associated with <e2> DISEASE </e2>.
VPOS-D(e1,e2)	CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the G allele of <e1> VARIANT </e1> polymorphism might be a potential risk factor for <e2> DISEASE </e2>, especially in whitepopulations.
