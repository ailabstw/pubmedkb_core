We examined whether a common genetic variant atchromosome 15q25 <e1> VARIANT </e1>, which is known to be involved in <e2> DISEASE </e2>, modifies the associations of maternal smoking with DISEASE.
We examined whether a common genetic variant atchromosome 15q25 <e1> VARIANT </e1>, which is known to be involved in DISEASE, modifies the associations of maternal smoking with <e2> DISEASE </e2>.
Among mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy (82.9%), maternal <e1> VARIANT </e1> was not consistently associated with any <e2> DISEASE </e2>.
Among mothers who continued smoking during pregnancy (17.1%), maternal <e1> VARIANT </e1> was not associated with <e2> DISEASE </e2>.
The T-allele of maternal <e1> VARIANT </e1> was associated with a smaller <e2> DISEASE </e2> [differences -0.23 mm (95%CI -0.45 to -0.00) and -0.41 mm (95%CI -0.69 to -0.13), respectively] and a DISEASE [difference -2.61 mm (95%CI -5.32 to 0.11)].
The T-allele of maternal <e1> VARIANT </e1> was associated with a smaller DISEASE [differences -0.23 mm (95%CI -0.45 to -0.00) and -0.41 mm (95%CI -0.69 to -0.13), respectively] and a <e2> DISEASE </e2> [difference -2.61 mm (95%CI -5.32 to 0.11)].
The maternal  T-allele of <e1> VARIANT </e1> was associated with a <e2> DISEASE </e2>, and tended to be associated with DISEASE [difference -38 grams (95%CI -89 to 13)]. This association persisted after adjustment for smoking quantity.

Our results suggest that maternal <e1> VARIANT </e1> genotype modifies the associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy with <e2> DISEASE </e2>.
Gene expression analysis indicated an association between genotypes of the <e1> VARIANT </e1> variant and CHRNA5 expression in brain and peripheral <e2> DISEASE </e2>, and with the rs16969968 and rs17477223 variants in brain.
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of   <e1> VARIANT </e1>, the intake of saturated fatty acids(SFA), and <e2> DISEASE </e2> on serum lipid levels in Lithuanian adult population.
CONCLUSIONS:  <e1> VARIANT </e1>, SFA intake, and <e2> DISEASE </e2> were found to be associated with blood lipid levels in Lithuanian adult population.
Analysis of gene-diet and gene-obesity interactions did not confirm that the effects of diet and <e2> DISEASE </e2> on TC and LDL-C level significantly depended on <e1> VARIANT </e1>.
Inside this region of 16.3 kb, LD (r2 = 0.14) between <e1> VARIANT </e1> and VARIANT was observed in <e2> DISEASE </e2>, but not in DISEASE and in controls.

Inside this region of 16.3 kb, LD (r2 = 0.14) between VARIANT and <e1> VARIANT </e1> was observed in DISEASE, but not in <e2> DISEASE </e2> and in controls.
RESULTS: In the discovery population, we observed an association between SIRT2 <e1> VARIANT </e1> T allele and <e2> DISEASE </e2> (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.50, P = .02, after correction for sex, age, and APOE ɛ4 genotype).
The association between <e2> DISEASE </e2> and SIRT2 <e1> VARIANT </e1> T allele was only present in APOE ɛ4 noncarriers (adjusted OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.61, P = .03).
Over an average period of three years, participants with the risk-conferring TT genotype at <e1> VARIANT </e1> were more likely to have progression from DISEASE to <e2> DISEASE </e2> than were CC homozygotes (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.20 to 2.01; P<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of   <e1> VARIANT </e1> did not differ between patients with <e2> DISEASE </e2> and controls.
The results indicated that homozygous <e1> VARIANT </e1> carriers aged 35 years or older had worse <e2> DISEASE </e2> than heterozygous carriers and noncarriers.

In conclusion, the major locus determining familial <e2> DISEASE </e2> up to high age as detected by GWAS was marked by <e1> VARIANT </e1>, which tags the deleterious effects of the ApoE ε4 allele.
RESULTS: After correcting for multiple testing (p<0.05) and accounting for significant differences in the association effect sizes between subjects with and without <e2> DISEASE </e2> (p<0.05), variants of APOA5 ( <e1> VARIANT </e1>) and APOE ( VARIANT) were associated with HDL-C and LDL-C responses in MetS subjects, while APOA4 VARIANT was associated with TG response in non-MetS subjects.

Our findings confirm that the <e1> VARIANT </e1> gene represents an important locus for predicting inherited susceptibility to <e2> DISEASE </e2>.
Five polymorphisms (-491 <e1> VARIANT </e1>, -427 VARIANT, -219 VARIANT, and ε VARIANT- VARIANT) were studied in 1308 <e2> DISEASE </e2> patients and 1082 control individuals from the Central-Northern Italy.

BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (ε2/ε3/ε4: <e1> VARIANT </e1> ε4 allele; VARIANT ε2 allele) is strongly associated with both lipid levels and A <e2> DISEASE </e2>'s disease.

Several markers in strong LD (r(2) > 0.7) with <e1> VARIANT </e1> were found to be significantly associated with <e2> DISEASE </e2> risk in recent genome-wide association studies with similar effect sizes, providing independent support of the current findings.
The frequency of the G genotype in COMT <e1> VARIANT </e1> was statistically different between patients with <e2> DISEASE </e2> and controls (P = .04), and between patients with DISEASE and controls (P = .02).
The frequency of the G genotype in COMT <e1> VARIANT </e1> was statistically different between patients with DISEASE and controls (P = .04), and between patients with <e2> DISEASE </e2> and controls (P = .02).
The frequency of the A genotype in PLCH1 <e1> VARIANT </e1> occurred more frequently in <e2> DISEASE </e2> than in controls (P = .02).

The G/G homozygous genotype in COMT VARIANT and A/A homozygous genotype in PLCH1 <e1> VARIANT </e1> were associated with DISEASE and <e2> DISEASE </e2>, respectively (odds ratio [OR] 0.61 and OR 2.01, respectively).
In this study, we found that the COMT <e1> VARIANT </e1> SNP was significantly associated with a reduced risk of <e2> DISEASE </e2>, especially DISEASE, which suggests that this SNP may have a protective effect.

CONCLUSIONS: We found no consistent association between <e1> VARIANT </e1> and <e2> DISEASE </e2>.
RESULTS: As previously reported in Spain, <e1> VARIANT </e1> allele was strongly associated with <e2> DISEASE </e2> in our series (OR=2.88 [95% C.I. 2.16- 3.84], p=7.38E-11).
Our results strengthen the evidence that one or more variants in <e1> VARIANT </e1> are associated with increased risk of <e2> DISEASE </e2>.
No combined effect of <e1> VARIANT </e1> polymorphisms on <e2> DISEASE </e2> phenotypes was observed.
<e1> VARIANT </e1> didn't affect <e2> DISEASE </e2>, suggesting its potential modality-specific effects on human pain.
We compared genotype frequencies in subjects with <e2> DISEASE </e2> with those with NGT and found marginal association for <e1> VARIANT </e1> (P = 0.05; odds ratio [OR] 1.51);
comparison between NGT control subjects and the combined <e2> DISEASE </e2>/IGT case group showed strong association with <e1> VARIANT </e1> and VARIANT (P = 0.008-0.01; OR 1.53-1.57) and marginal association with VARIANT and VARIANT (P = 0.07 and P = 0.04, respectively).
comparison between NGT control subjects and the combined <e2> DISEASE </e2>/IGT case group showed strong association with VARIANT and <e1> VARIANT </e1> (P = 0.008-0.01; OR 1.53-1.57) and marginal association with VARIANT and VARIANT (P = 0.07 and P = 0.04, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of <e1> VARIANT </e1> polymorphisms did not differ between patients with <e2> DISEASE </e2> and controls.

OBJECTIVE: Although several studies have reported an association between <e2> DISEASE </e2> (OSA) and the chromosomal region containing the Apolipoprotein E (  <e1> VARIANT </e1>) gene, findings about the exact location in the ApoE gene have been inconsistent.
The sliding window haplotype trend regression test revealed that SNP <e1> VARIANT </e1> was included in all haplotypes that are significantly associated with <e2> DISEASE </e2> status.
In a clinical setting,   <e1> VARIANT </e1> could offer additional biological evidence of whether a subject may develop DISEASE, but it is not robust enough to serve as an independent screening or predictive test in thediagnosis of <e2> DISEASE </e2>
